The code in this project is made to execute in the directory of the project. So all file paths in the program are "data/*.txt"
If the file can't be found, the program will give you an error and print where the program was executing. 

Also the files are written for mac so they use / instead of \, next to the inputText file in the code is the windows version of the path in a comment

In order to test all features, a user would start the game and say they they don't want to read in from a save file
then, user would make their way to Campus Walk West ('n', 'w', 'w') . There they will find the monroe hall key.
pickup the key using 'p monroe hall key' then make your way to monroe hall('w', 'n'). Without the key it doesn't let you in but with the key
it unlocks the door until the user exits the game. 

Make your way to katora coffee('s', 's', 'w'). Pickup the coffee item and type 'drink'. it will change into 'emptyCoffee' and you can check this by 
opening your backpack with 'b'. From there you can either 'refill' and then 'drink' again or 'recycle'.

If you travel to 4 'outdoor locations' in a row, it will start to rain and any time you travel it will say 'it is raining' before anything else
your 'outdoor location count' resets when you go inside so it will stop raining\

At any time you can save and then restart and it will save:
Your current location
If it is raining
What your distance is
How many outdoor locations you have visited in a row
Your backpack contents

to switch to verbose mode press v at any time

to check your distance press d at any time
