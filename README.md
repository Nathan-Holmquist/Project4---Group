# Merging
When you are done working on a branch, or you have made a new branch and finished what you set out to do, you can push that branch (git push origin/main) to main and it will initilize a "pull request" 
I will look through it and merge it into main. The first time you do this, check in on google or chatGPT, its a weird command at first. Only merge when you are totally done with your branch.
If you are still working on the branch, finish up your section (try to get it to a working state, its okay if you don't totally get there) then commit your changes and push to the repo. (don't push to main tho, that will make a pull request)
Push to the remote repo for your branch. (git push)
